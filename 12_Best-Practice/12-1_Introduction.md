# Best Practices

This part of the guide is organized in the spirit of a journal of “best practices”. It sheds light on several strategies that we have learned, through experience and research, to be most conducive to quality parametric workflows. As designers and programmers, our metric for quality is primarily concerned with the maintainability, dependability, usability, and efficiency of our tools. These best practices cover both visual programming (noding) and scripting.
